# Pyfaceitcs2
A version of Pyfaceit for CS2

Pyfaceitcs2 is a Python Package that makes it easy to retrieve data from Faceit API for Counter Strike Developers. Faceit API docs can be confusing and hard to implement,

This Python package does all the hard work behind the scenes, simply input the faceit name and retrieve all dat from a player, you can even retrieve specific map data.

I also added a way to get player details (username, avatar, country, skill_level, elo, etc)

The map data also doesn't matter if you type DE or not (the previous version also did this, but they changed the way they pull the data for CS2)
